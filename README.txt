1. Description how to run file:
In my source I have only one .java files and called VirtualMemory.java which is the only executable file necessary for my program. It works with both demand paging and without demand paging.
The IDE I used was IntelliJ. I imported my project using IntelliJ with JDK 22 version. Im not sure if you can use another IDE to run it. But to run it, go to the VirtualMemory.Java file (which contains main class) and build->compile from there.
It should produce an output-dp.txt and output-no-dp.txt which are identical to the one already in this zipped folder.
You do not need to use command lines, instead you can edit the input.txt and init.txt files if you want to add test cases.
Doing so will change the output.txt files after compilation.

2. In my zipped folder there is a list of files:
init-no-dp.txt (with test cases, can be edited for testing)
input-no-dp.txt (with test cases, can be edited for testing)
init-dp.txt (with test cases, can be edited for testing)
init-no-dp.txt (with test cases, can be edited for testing)
out (folder created when I changed the name of my folder)
output-no-dp.txt (output produced for without demand paging)
output-dp.txt (output produced for without demand paging)
